1. SELECT e.name, d.description FROM employee e, department d
WHERE e.department = d.id;

2. SELECT e.name, d.description FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d
ON e.department = d.id;

Answer:
Both of the result will give the same result. However
- the performance might be varied based on the database server
(but this is not that any different due to optimization of the engine itself)

I preferred 2nd option due to better readability. Moreover
- join should be used to logically join a table, while
- where is to filter data
In the 1st option, it hides the intention to join a table through 'where' clause
Which is for me a bit inappropriate
